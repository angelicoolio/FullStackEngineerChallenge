Assumptions made in this project:

1. Access control is not in this scope
2. Removing an employee indicates a complete removal of all records tied to that employee (including reviews made by or made for that employee)
3. The application uses Spring to do injections which in this project the configuration is not completed due to my time constraints.
4. Functions performed per interface are self explained.
